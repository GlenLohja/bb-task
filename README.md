## Overview

This application consists of a Django backend and a React frontend. The backend manages customer and loan offer data and performs loan calculations. The frontend allows users to input loan details and view calculated monthly payments.

## Design Choices

### Backend

- **Framework**: Django
- **Database**: SQLite
- **API Framework**: Django REST Framework (DRF)
  - **Reason**: DRF provides powerful and flexible tools for building Web APIs. It seamlessly integrates with Django, allowing for easy serialization, validation, and routing of API endpoints.
- **Models**:
  - **Customer**: Stores customer details such as first name, last name, and email.
  - **LoanOffer**: Stores loan offer details including customer reference, loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/customers`: Create a new customer.
  - `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}`: Retrieve details of a customer.
  - `POST /api/v1/loanoffers`: Create a loan offer for a customer.
  - `POST /api/v1/loan-calculator`: Calculate monthly loan payments based on the loan amount, interest rate, and term.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - **Reason**: Tailwind CSS provides a highly customizable, low-level utility-first CSS framework. It allows for rapid styling without leaving the HTML, leading to faster development and a more streamlined workflow.
- **Components**:
  - **LoanCalculator**: Main component that handles input fields for loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, and displays the calculated monthly payment.
  - **InputField**: Reusable input field component with validation and error display.

### Testing

- **Backend Testing**:
  - **Framework**: Django's built-in testing framework
  - **Tools**: unittest, Django Test Client
  - **Coverage**: Tests cover models, views, serializers, and API endpoints.

- **Frontend Testing**:
  - **Framework**: Jest
  - **Tools**: React Testing Library
  - **Coverage**: Tests cover components, hooks, and API interactions.

## Running the Application

### Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GlenLohja/bb-task
   cd bb-task
   ```

### Backend Setup

#### Prerequisites (**Required**)

**Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:**

- Python 3.x [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- pip (Python package installer)

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Apply database migrations:
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

#### Prerequisites (**Required**)

**Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:**

- Node.js (v14.x and above). [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node package manager)
- backend must be running
  
#### Setup

**To start go back to the main directory that we cloned earlier (bb-task)**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server (Keep django backend running for the calculator to work):
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   
The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

Django tests can be found in :  [backend/loan/tests](https://github.com/GlenLohja/bb-task/tree/main/backend/loan/tests)


1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Run the tests using Django's test runner
   ```sh
   python manage.py test loan/tests
   ```
### Frontend Tests

React (Jest) tests can be found in : [frontend/src/components/__tests__](https://github.com/GlenLohja/bb-task/tree/main/frontend/src/components/__tests__)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Run the tests using Jest
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
